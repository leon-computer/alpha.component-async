# alpha.component-async

ClojureScript support for asynchronous `start` and `stop` methods with Stuart Sierra's component library. 

Provides the `LifecycleAsync` protocol and an accompanying system loader. 

```clojure
(defrecord MyComponent []
  component-async/LifecycleAsync
  (start [this on-done on-error]
    (.. (js/SomeSDK.)
        (.then (fn [sdk]
                 (on-done 
                   (assoc this :sdk sdk))))))
  (stop [this on-done on-error]
    ;; ...
    )
  )
````

## Features
- Enables waiting in start and stop
- Starts and stops systems asynchronously
- Starts independent dependencies in parallel
- Supports adaptive integration of existing component systems
- No dependencies on heavy-weight async frameworks

## Rationale
For a maximally interactive development workflow, both Stuart Sierra's reloaded workflow and component library became indispensable tools in many Clojure projects.

Because ClojureScript is a single-threaded environment, blocking synchronous execution to await loading of external resources in `start` and `stop` methods is not possible.  Users expose promises, callbacks and channels from their components, delegating the waiting to their dependents.  For every operation, even in the post-start phase, such promises have to be unwrapped.  This leads to unpleasant boilerplate and ceremony.  

Furthermore, there are no means to await start and stop of a component system.  Therefore, a reset operation has no choice but to start a system while it might still be stopping.  For specific resources, custom synchronization workarounds are required to prevent a stopping and a starting system from competing.

Component was never designed for a host like ClojureScript, but component-async was.

## Usage
```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require
   [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
   [leon.computer.alpha.component-async :as component-async]))

;; All you need to do is to use the new protocol to declare async
;; components and to run your system.

;; Declare async component using component-async/LifecycleAsync
(defrecord MyAsyncComponent []
  component-async/LifecycleAsync
  (start [this on-done on-error]
    (.log js/console "Starting")
    (js/setTimeout
     (fn []
       (on-done
        (assoc this :started true))
       (.log js/console "Started"))
     2000))
  (stop [this on-done on-error]
    (.log js/console "Stopping")
    (js/setTimeout
     (fn []
       (on-done
        (assoc this :stopped true))
       (.log js/console "Stopped"))
     2000)))

;; You can mix with your existing components
(defrecord MyClassicComponent [my-async-component]
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (.log js/console
          (str "Started classic component, async component is: "
               (pr-str (:started async-component))))
    this)
  (stop [this]
    (.log js/console (str "Stopped classic component."))
    this))

;; You can use classic components system-map, component-async extends
;; its protocol onto it:

(def my-system
  (component/system-map
   :my-async-component (->MyAsyncComponent)
   :my-classic-component (-> (map->MyClassic-component {})
                             (component/using [:my-async-component]))))

(defn run []
  (component-async/start
   my-system
   (fn [stated-system]
     (.log js/console
           (str "Async system started: "
                (pr-str started-system))))
   (fn [err]
     (.log js/console
           "Async system start error: " err))))

;; Thats really all there is to it.
```
