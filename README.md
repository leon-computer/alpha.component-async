# alpha.component-async

ClojureScript support for asynchronous `start` and `stop` methods with Stuart Sierra's component library. 

Provides the `LifecycleAsync` protocol and an accompanying system loader. 

```clojure
(defrecord MyComponent []
  component-async/LifecycleAsync
  (start [this on-done on-error]
    (.. (js/SomeSDK.)
        (.then (fn [sdk]
                 (on-done 
                   (assoc this :sdk sdk))))))
  (stop [this on-done on-error]
    ;; ...
    )
  )
````

## Features
- Enables waiting in start and stop
- Starts and stops systems asynchronously
- Starts independent dependencies in parallel
- Supports adaptive integration of existing component systems
- No dependencies on heavy-weight async frameworks

## Rationale
For a maximally interactive development workflow, both Stuart Sierra's reloaded workflow and component library became indispensable tools in many Clojure projects.

Because ClojureScript is a single-threaded environment, blocking synchronous execution to await loading of external resources in `start` and `stop` methods is not possible.  Users expose promises, callbacks and channels from their components, delegating the waiting to their dependencies.  For every operation, even in the post-start phase, such promises have to be unwrapped.  This leads to unpleasant boilerplate and ceremony.  

Furthermore, there are no means to await start and stop of a component system.  Therefore, a reset operation has no choice but to start a system while it might still be stopping.  For specific resources, custom synchronization workarounds are required to prevent a stopping and a starting system from competing.

Component was never designed for a host like ClojureScript, but component-async was.
